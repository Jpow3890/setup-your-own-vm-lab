# Create a VM lab
Unbutu
VM requires 4gb of ram for maximum performance. The device used in operation only has 8gb so the settings had to be set to 2gb utilized. This caused the VM to perform slower and loading time increased dramastically during session. To troubleshoot I had to limit the amount of open applications so that the VM could perform. 
I could only alloocate 2gb of ram due to the computer's limited 8gb. The hard disk was set to 2 slots. Only the hard disk was set to reccommended settings while the ram had to be reduced so that VM work. 
If too much ram is allocated then the VM could crash or fail to power on
A optical disk was added because it is a MACOS this allows for backup. 
Before any commands were inputed or Cd Drives were added the system would crash or react slow. Once updates were made and necessary adjustments were added it now moves much quicker and visually better. 
Certain terminal commands were added such as Apt update and guest additions, this updated the version of Ubuntu which allowed for quicker responses.
